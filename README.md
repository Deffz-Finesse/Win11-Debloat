# AutoUnattend.xml: Your Ultimate Windows 11 Installation Automation Tool üñ•Ô∏è‚ú®

`AutoUnattend.xml` is a powerful automation file designed to streamline the installation of Windows 11, making the process faster, more efficient, and completely hands-free. Inspired by and partially generated using tools from [Schneegans Unattend Generator](https://schneegans.de/), it is packed with custom scripts, configurations, and optimizations that simplify setup while providing a clean, debloated, and optimized Windows environment.

## üéØ Features at a Glance

### **General Installation Automation**
- Automates user creation, partitioning, and regional settings.
- Automatically accepts the Windows license agreement (EULA).
- Configures the system to bypass user prompts during installation.

### **Bypassing Hardware Requirements**
- Enables installation on systems that do not meet Windows 11's strict hardware requirements by:
  - Bypassing TPM checks.
  - Ignoring Secure Boot requirements.
  - Allowing systems with lower RAM than required.

### **User Account Setup**
- Creates a local administrator account with customizable username and password (`(CHANGE WITH NAME)` and `(CHANGE WITH PASSWORD)` placeholders).
- Enables automatic login for the first user session.

### **Removing Bloatware and Unnecessary Features**
- Scripts embedded in the file systematically remove:
  - **Apps**: Xbox, OneDrive, Feedback Hub, Paint3D, Cortana, Weather, and more.
  - **Capabilities**: Internet Explorer, Fax and Scan, Windows Media Player.
  - **Features**: PowerShell V2, Remote Desktop Connection, Math Recognizer.
  - A detailed list of removed items can be found in the `remove-packages.ps1`, `remove-caps.ps1`, and `remove-features.ps1` scripts.

### **System Tweaks and Optimizations**
- Configures Windows Explorer to open to "This PC" and enables classic context menus.
- Disables unnecessary startup sounds and widgets.
- Activates long file paths and disables UAC (User Account Control) for smoother operations.

### **Windows Update Control**
- Temporarily pauses Windows Updates to maintain system stability during post-installation configurations.

### **Customizing the Default User Profile**
- Applies default settings such as enabling hidden files and showing file extensions.
- Silences system notifications and disables app suggestions.
- Ensures consistent preferences for all users created on the system.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### **What It Does**
1. **Automates Installation**: Removes manual inputs during the setup process for a smooth installation.
2. **Bypasses Hardware Checks**: Registry edits are applied during the `windowsPE` pass to bypass TPM, Secure Boot, and RAM checks.
3. **Customizes Windows**: Runs a series of embedded scripts (`.ps1`, `.vbs`, `.xml`) to remove unwanted apps, apply system tweaks, and finalize the setup.
4. **Prepares the Default User Profile**: Configures default settings to ensure a consistent experience across user accounts.

### **How It Does It**
The process is divided into configuration passes:
- **`windowsPE`**: Handles initial setup tasks like hardware requirement bypass and user data configuration.
- **`specialize`**: Executes core customizations and scripts for removing bloatware, disabling features, and applying registry tweaks.
- **`oobeSystem`**: Finalizes the user setup, configures auto-logon, and applies first-logon commands.

Embedded scripts handle tasks like:
- **`remove-packages.ps1`**: Removes pre-installed apps (e.g., Xbox, Weather, OneDrive).
- **`remove-caps.ps1`**: Removes capabilities like Internet Explorer and Math Recognizer.
- **`remove-features.ps1`**: Disables Windows features like PowerShell V2 and Remote Desktop.
